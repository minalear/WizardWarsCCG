# WizardWarsCCG
A collectable card game influenced by Magic: the Gathering and Hearthstone.

This is a simple game that doesn't strive to be anything more than a personal project and showpiece on a resume.  Some content is HEAVILY inspired by other games.  
I do not pretend to own any rights to these names or concepts, and do not intend to release any of this game as a commercial product.
